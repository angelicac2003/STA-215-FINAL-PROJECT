# STA-215-FINAL-PROJECT
Final project for STA 215
To access and utilize the script, open the "final_project_script.R"file, which contains the code for my findings. To access the dataset, open the "STA215_MIDAH.R - sheet" file.

The data used for the analyses was major cities across the US. The question that was being asked is,”Does poverty and immigration rates affect a city's population size at? This type of sampling is called convenience sampling along with stratified sampling. The sample includes 153 observations on poverty rates, immigration rates, and population size for each unit of analyses which was 388 U.S. cities in recent years. The unit of analysis is specifically city-level data, with the population representing cities with varying socioeconomic characteristics. The dataset has city’s with missing numbers either removed or supplied with a 0 to ensure accuracy. 

## **data**
I gathered data regarding poverty rates, immigration rates, population rates, along with birth rates. This was to fully understand the numbers before and after in the recent years including during the COVID pandemic. Then I would compare the variables to see if there was any noticeable difference.I operationalized each variable in a different way, more specifically population rate over 500k. 

## **Operationalization**
The Concept of poverty rate was operationalized as a variable representing the percentage of the population living below the poverty line. This operationalization allows for a nuanced understanding of economic hardship across different regions. 

The concept of population size was operationalized as the total number of individuals living in a city as of 2021 is over 500k. This categorization allows for a comparison between larger urban areas and smaller regions. This was also operationalized through creating a qualitative coding scheme from yes and no converted to 1 for yes and 0 for no.
